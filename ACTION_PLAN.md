### Decision Time (5 min):

**Choose ONE:**

#### Path A: Stay with HTML
```
✅ Quick win
✅ No learning curve
✅ Current setup works
❌ Longer HTML files
❌ Less scalable
❌ Hard to add features

Action:
→ Just keep current setup
→ Read: "Minimize HTML" if want smaller files
→ No migration needed
```

#### Path B: Learn & Migrate to Next.js ⭐
```
✅ Modular code
✅ Scalable
✅ Modern tech
✅ Better for career
✅ Vercel optimized
❌ Takes 3-5 hours
❌ Learning curve

Action:
→ Read: "THREE_QUESTIONS_ANSWERED.md"
→ Check: Next.js tutorials
→ Decide: Worth it for you?
→ Plan: Timeline for migration
```
